Dataset1 contains 2600 images of ear divided as 13 classes or groups
this dataset used to train the proposed CNN deep neural network in our paper ("Ear Recognition System Using Deep Learning")
also, this dataset used to train classifier and to make the database for the final project
note:
520  images for each test and validation sets
1560 images for the training set
008,009 and 010 groups used as unknown
