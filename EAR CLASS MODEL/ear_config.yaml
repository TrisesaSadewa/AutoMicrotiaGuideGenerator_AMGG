# YOLOv8 Training Configuration for Ear Detection

# --- Dataset Paths ---
# CRITICAL: This is the absolute root path to your data.
# The 'train', 'val', and 'test' paths below are RELATIVE to this root.
path: C:\Users\Trise\Documents\TRS\ITS\PROJECT\AUTO BONE SUBSTRACT\Code\EAR CLASS MODEL\ear recognition datasets\Dataset1

# Assuming you create subfolders inside Dataset1 for YOLO format:
# Path to training images (e.g., Dataset1/train/images/)
train: train data
# Path to validation images (you will need to split your data for this)
val: validation data
# Path to test images (optional, you will need to split your data for this)
test: test data

# --- Classes ---
# We are training an EAR DETECTION model (one class: 'ear')
nc: 1  # Number of classes
names: ['ear'] 

# --- Training Parameters (Recommended) ---
# epochs: 50 
# imgsz: 640 
# batch: 16 # Adjust based on your GPU
